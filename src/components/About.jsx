        A student at NUST, Islamabad pursuing a major in Software Engineering
        currently exploring different fields in Computer Science such as Web
        Development and Machine Learning as well as learning creative skills
        such as Video Editing and Graphic Design. I try to find the opportunity
        to learn in every situation and strongly believe that learning is a
        continuous process. I love networking and collaborating with people as
        it allows me learn from them and grow as a person.
